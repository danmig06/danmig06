- Hi, I’m an 18 year old high school student who's new to programming, i've been writing small, simple programs in C/C++, Java, Python since 2021 and, only recently, Rust
- I’m interested in useful applications (like applications that facilitate the use of complicated APIs/devices etc...) and emulators, the latter of which are my objective as a future project as they require knowledge about specific microprocessors, architectures and how they work together 
- I’m currently learning OOP skills in pretty much all the languages that i use
