- Hi, I’m an 11th grade student who's new to programming, i've been writing small, simple programs in C/C++, C# and Python since 2021 
- I’m interested in useful applications (like applications that improve the use of proprietary APIs etc...) and emulators, the latter of which are my objective as a future project as they require knowledge about specific microprocessors, architectures and how they work together 
- I’m currently learning OOP skills in pretty much all the languages that i use
