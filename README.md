- Hi, I’m a 19 year old University Student at the University of Salerno, i've been programming mainly in C, but also for relatively smaller projects in C++, Java, and Python since 2021 and, more recently, Rust.
- I’m interested in making useful applications that solve obscure problems (such as applications that facilitate the use of complicated APIs/devices etc...), Reverse Engineering and emulators, the latter of which are my objective as a future project as they require knowledge about specific microprocessors, architectures and how they work together.
- I’m currently focusing on lower-level projects, i develop all my applications on Linux and i try to make them cross-platform when possible.
